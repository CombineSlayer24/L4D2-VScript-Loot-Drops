# L4D2-VScript-Loot-Drops - [WIP]
The have been bogarting the supplies. Take them when you kill them. You might find some cool stuff.

This VScript is inspired by Gun Nuts, a mutation that when infected are killed, they drop loot. I wanted to take that Mutation and make it into a global VScript, allowing this script to work on any game mode. This script is still WIP.

# Bugs:
- Light and particle effect can still be presisant when an item is picked up and dropped very quickly.
